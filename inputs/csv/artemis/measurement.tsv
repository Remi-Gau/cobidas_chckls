Latency measurement		Approach to selection of the window within which latency was located		A priori: the window is selected in advance Data-driven: the measurement window is selected based on data obtained in the current study. In a data driven approach, either a wider window or the entire epoch are analyzed or examined to determine which will be the final analysis window.  Entire epoch: latency is identified based on the entire epoch instead of a narrower window (e.g. peak of the entire waveform, mass univariate approch on the entire epoch etc.).
