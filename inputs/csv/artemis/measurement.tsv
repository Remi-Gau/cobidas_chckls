Measurement	This is a section where amplitude and latency measurement are described.	Did you measure amplitude and/or latency for the purposes of later statistical analysis?		Select no if you did not measure latency or amplitude for the purposes of statistical analysis in the next step. For example, you may have conducted a mass univariate analysis and you did not subject locations and time windows fof effect to a further analysis, or you may have conducted a source analysis.	radio	preset:boolean	measure_intro	1	1	1	1	Measurement	6

In a data driven approach, either a wider window or the entire epoch are analyzed or examined to determine which will be the final analysis window.  Entire epoch: latency is identified based on the entire epoch instead of a narrower window (e.g. peak of the entire waveform, mass univariate approch on the entire epoch etc.).
