Triggers		Describe your trigger signal input.	1. If your system delivers triggers online during the acquisition of EEG to the amp, e.g., via a parallel port, serial port, or TCP/IP select option 1.  2. If your system delivers triggers online during the acquisition of EEG to the amp via a USB port (including serial port over USB (e.g., arduino, LabJack U3, or similar)) or another digital signal format select option 2.  3 & 4 - if the triggers are not delivered to amplifiers, but to the acquisition computer, select the appropriate option 3 or 4 depending on whether the trigger is transfered using an analogue (e.g. parallel port) or digital (e.g. USB) channel  5. If triggers are added after the recording (e.g. after analysis of an audio recording of spoken responses), select option 5.	select	TriggerChannelCount	Trigger_signal_input	TriggerChannelCount	*_eeg.json	1	15	1	1	Hardware	2
