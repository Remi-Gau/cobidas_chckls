What determined the number of trials each subject was presented with?	Adaptive N could include a) online exclusion of bad trials that are presented once again later, b) addition of extra trials on the basis of online subjective data quality checks, c) using a threshold based on of participants' behaviour (i.e., learning effect or attention checks), ...	radio	fixed N of trials delivered | adaptive N of trials (please explain) | Other (please explain)	trial_presentation_strategy	1	1	1	1	Experimental design and sample	Presented trials		design_and_sample	4
