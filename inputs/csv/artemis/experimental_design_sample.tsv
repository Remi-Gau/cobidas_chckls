How did you decide to present trials?	adaptive N could include online exclusion of bad trials that are re-presented again later, or addition of extra trials on the basis of online subjective data quality checks, or using a threshold of participant behaviour (i.e., learning effect or attention checks).	radio	fixed N of trials delivered | adaptive N of trails (please explain) | Other (please explain)	trial_presentation_strategy	1	1	1	1	Experimental design and sample	Presented trials		design_and_sample	4
