Selection of channels for analysis	Please specify channel electrode choice in this section, inclusion and excusion criteria and channel montages analysed. 	How did you decide which channels would be included/excluded from analysis	e.g., 2. include exclusion of O2 after discovering loose caps cause faulty contacts over this region;  e.g., 3. select channels where sensory peaks are most cleanly detected (regardless of experimental condition), prior to comparing peaks across conditions e.g., 4. after viewing the ERP per condition, selection of channels showing largest difference in time regions of interest 	radio_multiple	a-priori selection of particular channels | a priori criteria for inclusion/exclusion | inclusion/exclusion decisions made after recording | all channels are used for measurement and analysis | other	channel_incl_excl_for_analysis	1	1	1	1	Channel choice	7							*_channels.tsv	description
Selection of channels for analysis		A-priori channel inclusion/exclusion type	Reason to include/exclude this specific combination of electrodes in the main analysis.  e.g.,  1. previous N400 literature shows electrode X,  and Y  e.g., 2. this effect is predicted to appear over the frontal pole.

Selection of channels for analysis		Describe the visual inspection process for signal/noise for channel inclusion/exclusion	e.g., 'channels visually identified as noisy at the time of recording were excluded'; 'channels that were identified as unstable, (i.e., frequently losing contact at the time of recording) were excluded' 'after calculation of the grant average, channels that do not show a clear PNP complex were excluded'	text		channel_incl_excl_after_rec_observed_visual	channel_incl_excl_after_rec_observed.includes(0)	11	1	1	Channel choice	7

Selection of channels for analysis		Explain your missing data reconstruction implemented for all participants and all trials	Data from all participants were experienced the same missing data, and the same reconstruction was applied to all recordings for all participants. e.g.,  'Due to an electrical fault in the amplifier, no signal was detected from T3, so T3 was reconstructed from the average of the two nearest electrodes',  	text		channel_reconstruction_all	channel_reconstruction_cases == 0	19	1	1	Channel choice	7
