How did you decide which channels would be included/excluded from analysis	e.g., 2. include exclusion of O2 after discovering loose caps cause faulty contacts over this region;  e.g., 3. select channels where sensory peaks are most cleanly detected (regardless of experimental condition), prior to comparing peaks across conditions e.g., 4. after viewing the ERP per condition, selection of channels showing largest difference in time regions of interest 	select_multiple	a-priori decision inclusion/exclusion of channels | noise-dependent inclusion/exclusion of channels | signal-dependent inclusion/exclusion of channels | condition-dependent inclusion/exclusion of channels | all channels are used for measurement and analysis | other	channel incl-excl for analysis	1	1	1	1	Channel (electrode) choice	Channel choise for analysis		Channel choise for analysis	6
