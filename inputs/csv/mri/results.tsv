	If reporting R^2 (coefficient of determination) clarify how nuisance variability is considered. For instance, in task fMRI the vast majority of variance is explained by slow temporal drift, and R^2 values for an effect of interest will be vastly different if computed with or without counting drift in the total variance		textarea		tmp1	0	1	5	analysis_type.includes(1)	1	Results	mass_univariate	Extracted data		0
