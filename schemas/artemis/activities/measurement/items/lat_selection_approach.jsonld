In a data driven approach, either a wider window or the entire epoch are analyzed or examined to determine which will be the final analysis window.  Entire epoch: latency is identified based on the entire epoch instead of a narrower window (e.g. peak of the entire waveform, mass univariate approch on the entire epoch etc.). Please specify details in the Further clarification column [if 1 was selected, jump to 6.4.2.1; if 2 was selected, jumpe to 6.4.2.2] If 3 or 4 was selected, specify in \"further clarification\" filed.</details></div>"
