# Welcome to the eCOBIDAS documentation

## Motivations

Poor methods and results description hinders the reproducibility and the
replicability of research. It also makes it hard to compare new and old results
and generally increases inefficiency in the research process. This project is
built on the hope that improving methods and results reporting could improve our
research.

See [here](./motivations.md) for more background information.

## Goals

The short term goal of this project is to make the COBIDAS report (and other
best practices for methods reporting) easier to use: we want to create a website
with a clickable checklist that, at the end, automatically generates most of the
method section of a (f)MRI / (i)EEG / MEG / PET paper.

See [here](./goals.md) for more information on our vision and general goals.
You can also go directly to one of the following section to see a breakdown of
those goals and see some extensions we have in mind for the project.

1.  [intermediate goals](./mid-term.md)
1.  [long term goals](./long-term.md)

Contributing to this project does not necessarily require super-advanced
technical skills (except maybe a certain love for working with spreadsheet and
wanting them to be super organized) :wink:.

## Project structure

See [here](./general-organization.md) for more information about how this
whole project is organized.

## Spreadsheets

A lot of the work for this projects starts with some (usually pretty big)
spreadsheets.

See [here](./spreadsheets.md) for a description of their content and what the
work involves.

## How to run the checklist

See [here](./how-to-render-the-checklist.md) for more information on how to
work on the checklist on your own computer.
