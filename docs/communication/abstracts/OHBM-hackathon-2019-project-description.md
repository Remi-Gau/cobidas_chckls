# Improving the COBIDAS checklist for better neuroimaging methods and results reporting

## Project Description

In 2012, in his review of the methods and results reporting of more than 200
fMRI papers, [Joshua Carp wrote](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22796459):
"_Although many journals urge authors to describe their methods to a level of
detail such that independent investigators can fully reproduce their efforts,
the results described here suggest that few studies meet this criterion._"

A few years ago, in order to improve the situation with respect to
[reproducibility](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2019/blob/master/Tutorial_Resources.md#reproducible-neuroimaging-tools)
in f/MRI research, the Committee on Best Practices in Data Analysis and Sharing
([COBIDAS](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3728))
of OHBM released a [report](https://doi.org/10.1101/054262 ) to
promote best practices for methods and results reporting. This was recently
followed by a [similar initiative for EEG and MEG](https://osf.io/a8dhx/).

So far these guidelines do not seem to have been widely adopted and anecdotal
evidence
([see that twitter poll and thread](https://treeverse.app/view/Xf3jfvIZ))
suggests that even among people who know about the report few of them use it to
write or review papers. One likely reason for this might be the unwieldy nature
of the report. Anyone who has used this checklist tends to agree that it is a
great resource but that it is a bit cumbersome to interpret and apply.

So the short term goal of this project is to facilitate the use of this
checklist. But, if done right, this could also in the long term enhance the
adoption of emerging neuroimaging standards
([the Brain imaging data structure](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2019/blob/master/Tutorial_Resources.md#the-brain-imaging-data-structure-bids),
fMRIprep, NIDM...), facilitate data sharing and pre-registration, help with
peer-review...

### Short term goal

**The short term goal of this project is to make the COBIDAS report easier to
use: we want to create a website with a clickable checklist that generates a
json file at the end.**

By turning the checklist into a website users could more rapidly click through
it and provide more of the information requested by the COBIDAS report. This
would generate a small text file (a json file) that summarizes what option was
chosen for each item of the checklist. This machine readable file could then be
used to automatically generate part of the methods section of an article.

Other potential goals (e.g. interaction with BIDS and NIDM, further integration
with main neuroimaging softwares...) and potential applications (improving
data-sharing and peer-review) of this project are described in this
[repository](https://github.com/Remi-Gau/COBIDAS_chckls).

## Skills required to participate

One or more of those:

-   To be enthusiastic about reproducibility
-   Familiarity with the COBIDAS report for f/MRI, MEEG,
-   To know something about web design,
-   Familiarity with one or more of the main neuroimaging software for
    [fMRI](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2019/blob/master/Tutorial_Resources.md#neuroimaging)
    (SPM, FSL...) or for
    [M/EEG](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2019/blob/master/Tutorial_Resources.md#main-eeg-and-meg-softwares)
    (Fieldtrip, EEGlab...)

## Milestones

-   Discuss conceptual and structural details of the COBIDAS-json file.

-   Create a template of the COBIDAS-json file

-   Create a proof of concept website that can:
    -   given a template COBIDAS-json file generates a checklist to clicked
        through by users,
    -   outputs a populated COBIDAS-json file once the user is done,
    -   generate a method section using a populated COBIDAS-json file.

## Preparation material

Jeanette Mumford has a
[30 min video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsM4KowO5Vc&t=175s) on her
youtube channel explaining the background behind the COBIDAS report and giving a
run through of the checklist.

The COBIDAS report:

-   [for MRI and fMRI](https://doi.org/10.1101/054262 )
-   [for EEG and MEG](https://osf.io/a8dhx/)
