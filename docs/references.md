## About the checklist

-   [our project on the Open-Science Framework](https://osf.io/anvqy/) with the
    [DOI:10.17605/OSF.IO/ANVQY](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/ANVQY) is a
    where we try to centralize all the information across repos, google drive...

## The COBIDAS reports

-   [for MRI and fMRI](https://doi.org/10.1101/054262)

-   [for EEG and MEG](https://osf.io/a8dhx/)

-   MEEG report presentation at
    [OHBM 2019](https://www.pathlms.com/ohbm/courses/12238/sections/15843/video_presentations/138196)

Jeanette Mumford has a

the background behind the COBIDAS report and giving a run through of the
checklist.

Presentation slides made about this project can be found in the
[presentations folder](./communication/presentations).
