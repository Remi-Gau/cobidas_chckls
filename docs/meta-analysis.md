# Meta-analysis

The items of the eCobidas checklist can also be used for systemative literature reviews.

For example the items of the Neurovault, PET and eyetracking checklists
are available as JSONL files labels for the [LabelBuddy software](https://jeromedockes.github.io/labelbuddy/labelbuddy/current/).
on the [cobidas_schema GutHub repository](https://github.com/ohbm/cobidas_schema/tree/master/labels).

For more information on how to use LabelBuddy check the [Litmining documentation](https://litmining.github.io/)
