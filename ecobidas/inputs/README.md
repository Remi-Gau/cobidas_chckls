# Source spreadsheets

Content used to programmatically generate the different schemas used for the different eCOBIDAS apps.

The google spreadsheet can be downloaded using the scripts [`download_tsv.sh`](../../download_tsv.sh).

The `csv` files can be turned into schemas using the python code in the [`python`](../../python) folder.

The content of the different columns is described in `data_dictionary.json` and
the `json` files associated with each file.
