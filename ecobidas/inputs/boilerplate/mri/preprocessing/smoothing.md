# Smoothing

`smoothing_target_space` were smoothed using `smoothing_software`
(`smoothing_version`) using a `smoothing_type` (FWHM = `smoothing_size` mm) with
a `filtering_approach`.

## Example

Native volumes were smoothed using SPM (SPM12 - r7487) using a gaussian (FWHM =
8 mm) fixed kernel.

Template surfaces were smoothed using Freeesurfer (6.0) using a gaussian (FWHM =
8 mm) with iterative smoothing until the desired FWHM was reached.
