The recordings were performed in the BCBL,  , Zoomlandia.

MR data were acquired on International space station with software version:  .

This MRI scanner is a 7-Tesla Terra 
from Sielips / Phimens with serial number 1234. 

A   receiver coil was used with the following characteristics 
for the receiver coil ReceiveCoilActiveElements  .

A   gradient coil was used.

A   transmit coid was used.

A   was used to reduce the number of independent channels by 
combining in analog the signals from multiple coil elements. 

The following coil combination method was used  . 

The anatomical MRI data were collected with following parameters.

This data was acquired using a   variant of  , 
a   MPRAGE with options  .


The image(s) were corrected for gradient nonlinearities by this scanner sequence.


 

This data was acquired using 2 radio-frequency excitations, 
with a phase encoding directon along i, with 
an effective echo spacing  seconds and total readout 
time of , using GRAPPA parallel imaging with a factor of
2, a partial Fourrier of  
in the   direction.

This data was acquired using a flip angle of 90.

For this multiband acquisition, the multiband factor was  .

repetition time, TR=ms;
echo time, TE=2ms;
inversion time, TE= ms;
